Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jaime, a 20-year-old student at 42 Madrid. I joined 42 in September 2023, and since then, I've been immersed in a wide range of projects that have strengthened my skills, from basic functions to algorithms and graphical projects.

My GitHub is a reflection of my journey in software development, showcasing projects that illustrate my progress and ongoing learning. There are still many projects to come, and I'm excited about what the future holds in my career.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and find inspiration for your own journey in software development.

Also here is my 42 intra profile if you want to check my progression in the cursus
