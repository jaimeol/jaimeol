Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jaime, student at 42 Madrid.

My GitHub is a reflection of my journey in software development, showcasing projects that illustrate my progress and ongoing learning. Here you will find all of my 42 common-core projects and some other interesting projects I do on my own.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and find inspiration for your own journey in software development.

Also here is my 42 intra profile if you want to check my progression in the cursus(you must be a 42 student):  [jolivare](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/jolivare)
